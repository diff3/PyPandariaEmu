A Python AuthServer for World of Warcraft - Mists of Pandaria

PyPandariaEmu is a custom authentication server designed for World of Warcraft - Mists of Pandaria, version 5.4.8. It is compatible with both [Skyfire 5.4.8](https://codeberg.org/ProjectSkyfire/SkyFire_548) and [Pandaria 5.4.8](https://github.com/alexkulya/pandaria_5.4.8) servers. This AuthServer manages authentication but does not replace the WorldServer, which is still required from either Skyfire or Pandaria.

To set up, provide database login credentials for the Skyfire or Pandaria servers. Additionally, patch the `wow.exe` client as you would with Skyfire.

Please note that this project is intended as a learning tool and does not aim to create a fully functional server.
